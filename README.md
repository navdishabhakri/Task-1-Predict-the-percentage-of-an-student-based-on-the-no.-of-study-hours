# Task-1-Predict-the-percentage-of-an-student-based-on-the-no.-of-study-hours

This task is part of my internship with The Sparks Foundation. We were each given a dataset to work with. The dataset was brief and clean. It only had two columns: Hours and Scores. My assumption was that the number of hours spent studying must be related to your grade. I used Python to further analyze my assumption.

Aim:
To predict the percentage of marks of a student based on the number of hours they studied

Data Cleaning & Preparation step:
• There was no null value in the dataset so I jumped to the data analysis and visualization part

Data Analysis:
• Developed charts using seaborn to convey important information.
• Performed correlation analysis between the “Marks Percentage” and “Hours Studied”.
• Plotted a regression line to confirm the correlation.
• Implemented a linear regression model to analyze the data and gain insights
• Evaluated the Mean absolute error of the model to check if our analysis is correct.

Conclusion:
* There is a positive correlation between the variables
* The Mean absolute error came to 4.13. A small value of mean absolute error states that the chances of error or wrong forecasting through the model are very less.
* The predicted score of a student, if he/she studies for 9.25 hrs/ day, is 93.893
* We can rely on this result as the MAE is so less.
